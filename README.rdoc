= KingPlaceholder

Add placeholder substitution for strings:

  @user.expand_placeholders("Hello [user.first_name]")
  => Hello Schorsch

This gem was extraced from SalesKing where it handles placeholders substitution
for user supplied email-, text- and export- templates.

It can handle relations and collections

  class User
    has_many :comments
  end

  @user.expand_placeholders("[comments][text][/comments]")
  => All comment texts

  @user.expand_placeholders("[comments.1.text]")
  => First comment text


== TODO

This gems still relies on king_views with king_format, for money, date
formatting. We will outsource king_format into its own gem and remove more
SalesKing internal dependencies.
